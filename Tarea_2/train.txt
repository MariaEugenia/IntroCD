__label__Hamlet to be  or not to be- that is the question  whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles  and by opposing end them  to die- to sleep- no more  and by a sleep to say we end the heartache  and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to  'tis a consummation  devoutly to be wish'd  to die- to sleep  to sleep- perchance to dream  ay  there is the rub  for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil  must give us pause  there is the respect that makes calamity of so long life  for who would bear the whips and scorns of time  th' oppressor's wrong  the proud man's contumely  the pangs of despis'd love  the law's delay  the insolence of office  and the spurns that patient merit of th' unworthy takes  when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin  who would these fardels bear  to grunt and sweat under a weary life  but that the dread of something after death- the undiscover'd country  from whose bourn no traveller returns- puzzles the will  and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of  thus conscience does make cowards of us all   and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought  and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action - soft you now  the fair ophelia - nymph  in thy orisons be all my sins rememb'red

__label__Hamlet such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty  calls virtue hypocrite  takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love  and sets a blister there  makes marriage vows as false as dicers' oaths  o  such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks  the very soul  and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words  heaven's face doth glow  yea  this solidity and compound mass  with tristful visage  as against the doom  is thought-sick at the act

__label__Falstaff  to silence  who has drunk a bumper  why  now you done me right 
__label__Hamlet a bloody deed- almost as bad  good mother  as kill a king  and marry with his brother
